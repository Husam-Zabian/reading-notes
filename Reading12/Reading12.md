# The key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries
Sure! Here's a more summarized version:

1. Matplotlib:
   * Offers flexibility and customization for creating static, publication-quality plots.
   * Suitable for a wide range of plot types and allows fine-grained control over appearance.
   * Example: Line plots with customizations for stock price trends over time.

2. Seaborn:
   * Built on Matplotlib, provides a higher-level interface for statistical graphics.
   * Simplifies the creation of complex visualizations, particularly for exploring datasets.
   * Example: Scatter plots with regression lines to examine variable relationships.

3. Bokeh:
   * Designed for interactive, browser-based visualizations like dashboards.
   * Offers tools for interactivity like panning, zooming, and hovering.
   * Efficiently handles large datasets and emphasizes user interaction.
   * Example: Interactive geographic plots for exploring earthquake distribution on a map.

# In the Seaborn library the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots:

1. Relational Plots:
   - `scatterplot()`: Shows the relationship between two numerical variables.
   - `lineplot()`: Depicts the trend or continuity between data points.
   - Purpose: Visualize relationships and patterns between variables.
   - Example Use Case: Analyzing the correlation between horsepower and fuel efficiency using a scatter plot.

2. Categorical Plots:
   - `barplot()`: Displays the distribution of a categorical variable.
   - `countplot()`: Shows the count of each category in a categorical variable.
   - `boxplot()`: Visualizes the distribution of a numerical variable across categories.
   - Purpose: Provide insights into categorical data distribution and comparisons.
   - Example Use Case: Visualizing sales performance of different products with a bar plot.

3. Distribution Plots:
   - `histplot()`: Displays the distribution of a single numerical variable.
   - `kdeplot()`: Visualizes the probability density function of a variable.
   - `rugplot()`: Represents the distribution of data points with vertical lines.
   - Purpose: Analyze the spread, shape, and characteristics of numerical data.
   - Example Use Case: Investigating the distribution of test scores using a histogram.

# To load a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame:
1. Import Pandas using `import pandas as pd`.
2. Specify the file path or URL.
3. Use the appropriate Pandas function to read the dataset and create a DataFrame.
4. Common file formats and corresponding functions are:
   - CSV: `pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')`.
   - Excel: `pd.read_excel('dataset.xlsx')`.
   - JSON: `pd.read_json('dataset.json')`.
   - SQL databases: `pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM table', connection)`.
   - Other formats: HDF (`pd.read_hdf()`), Parquet (`pd.read_parquet()`), Feather (`pd.read_feather()`).
5. Perform data operations and analysis on the loaded DataFrame using Pandas functions.

Remember to adjust function parameters for specific requirements, such as delimiter characters or sheet names. Pandas offers flexibility for handling various data formats effectively.
