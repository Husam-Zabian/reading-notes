# Pain vs Suffering
 
## Main difference between pain & suffering

* Learning Python involves pain and struggle, but it is necessary for growth and progress.
* Suffering can arise when negative emotions such as self-doubt or fear start to dominate the learning process.
* Adopting a growth mindset can help avoid suffering and instead turn challenges into opportunities for learning and personal development.

## How to overcoming these challenges and the Strategies that could be taken

* Break complex problems into smaller tasks for easier understanding and approach.
* Consistently practice Python, even if just a few minutes daily, to build momentum.
* Seek help from communities, mentors, or tutors when needed.
* Focus on progress, not perfection, and embrace mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow.

# Big O notation

We Use Time complexity and space complexity to evaluate the performance of algorithms. 

* Time complexity : refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete 
* space complexity :  refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses .
* Big O notation is used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input.
* It is used to determine how an algorithm's performance will scale as the input size grows larger.
* The "O" in Big O represents the upper bound or worst-case scenario for an algorithm's time complexity.
* Different types of algorithms have different time complexities, and understanding Big O can help you choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.

# Names and Values in Python

### Mutable:

* Mutable objects can be changed after creation, allowing for dynamic updates and modifications.
* Examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
* Changing a mutable object will modify its value in-place, and any references to the object will reflect the updated value.

### Immutable:

* Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation, ensuring their values remain constant.
* Examples of immutable objects include integers, strings, and tuples.
* Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the updated value, leaving the original object unchanged.
