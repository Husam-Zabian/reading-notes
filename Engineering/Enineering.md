# How to think like a programmer


1. Break down problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
2. Identify patterns and generalize them to create reusable solutions.
3. Always consider edge cases and exceptions in your solutions.
4. Write code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
5. Use pseudocode or diagrams to plan out your code before writing it.
6. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
7. Continuously learn and improve your programming skills by seeking feedback and practicing regularly.

# Solving Problems

1. Understand the problem by reading it thoroughly and identifying the requirements.
2. Break the problem down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
3. Plan out your solution by considering different approaches and selecting the best one.
4. Write the code, starting with the simplest solution and building upon it.
5. Test your code frequently to ensure that it works as expected and handle any errors or bugs that arise.
6. Refactor your code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
7. Reflect on the problem-solving process and identify ways to improve for future challenges.

# when I get stuck on a tough piece of code i follow this steps

1. Take a break and come back to the code later with a fresh perspective.
2. Break the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.
3. Research the problem and potential solutions online or in programming resources.
4. Ask for help from colleagues, mentors, or online communities.
5. Debug the code step-by-step to identify any errors or issues.

# What I've learned from The Super Mario Effect

1. Do not let any body effect you in a negative way and stops you from achieving your goals
2. Keep focus on the results and the level that you are in right now, not the failure that you have been through
3. When you achieve your goal you will forget all the pain and sad times that you have been through your entire journey
4. Learning from your mistakes will give you more confident and experience to avoid the next mistakes
