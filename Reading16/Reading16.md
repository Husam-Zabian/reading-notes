
## Serverless Computing:
- No server management: Developers don't have to worry about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance.
- Event-driven and scalable: Functions are triggered by events, and the infrastructure scales automatically to handle the workload.
- Pay-per-use pricing: You only pay for the actual execution time and resources consumed by your functions.
- Stateless execution: Functions don't maintain persistent connections or session information.
- Rapid development and deployment: Focus on writing modular functions and deploy updates quickly.
- Microbilling and auto-scaling: Fine-grained billing and automatic resource scaling based on workload.
- Third-party service integration: Easily integrate with external services and APIs.

## Traditional Server-based Architectures:
- Manual server management: Developers handle server configuration, scaling, and maintenance.
- Fixed resource allocation: Resources are provisioned upfront, leading to over/underutilization.
- Developer-operated: Responsibility for server management lies with the developers.
- Longer development and deployment cycles: More time-consuming processes.
